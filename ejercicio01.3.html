    <table>
        <caption> As we headed towards the 2015s, memes began to get popular on mainstream media like Insta, Facebook, twitter, YouTube… People began to express their opinions on the Internet through memes, which meant memes were becoming more relatable and more popular. Memes describe a situation with a perfect reaction image that resonates with the soul. But memes through social media meant that they were more accessible to everyone and their objective was to be as relatable as possible. But with opinions, rises cynicism. This attitude has caused the humour to shift focus on two things: nº 1, mockery and parody and nº 2, is obscurity. The humour of the Internet has evolved so much that we find humour on stuff that is stupid and insane. Everything means nothing and that alone is art personified. Memes have gotten so out of context and stupid that it’s become hilarious to people. With all the craziness happening, memes come and go like the wind over the years. If memes were an inside joke, mainstream media would be that one guy that makes you hear it again and again that you wouldn’t want to hear them again. But sometimes, old memes are refreshing to hear every now and then.  </caption>
